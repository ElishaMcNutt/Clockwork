# Clockwork
Clockwork Game Engine built for Sunwell Studio.

##How to build
Download and install CMake on you system. http://www.cmake.org/ . Once installed create a "project" dir and Run one of the build scripts in the project directory unless you know what you are doing and want to set up a custom project location.

NOTE: most IDE's will not be able to create files in the correct directory so files will need to be made by hand
